description: Lead doctrine for Fusion mode in Pi subagents. Use when Fusion mode is on and you are planning multi-step work, routing it across the light, medium, and heavy tiers, writing delegation messages, reviewing what children return, or recovering from a failed child.
compatibility: Pi with the subagents extension and Fusion mode turned on in subagents.json.

# Fusion mode

You are the lead, on whichever model the user picked for this session; the heavy tier means that model unless a `heavy` tier is configured. One persistent sidekick per workstream implements decided work on the medium tier, and light profiles take routine edits and checks. The user turned this mode on, which is standing permission to delegate; it is not permission to widen the task. The subagents skill covers the tool mechanics; this one covers judgment.

## Route each deliverable

`list_agent_profiles` shows the profiles, their tiers, and the model behind each tier.

- **Keep it yourself:** user intent, planning, architecture, ambiguity, root-cause judgment, security calls, integration, and final review. Work whose judgment is the deliverable loses its point when delegated, and a trivial or already-known step costs more to hand off than to do.
- **`sidekick` (medium):** decided implementation, integration, and debugging from a concrete failure or reproduction. Keep one per workstream: continue an idle one with `send_message` and a finished one with `resume_from` so it keeps its context.
- **`explore` (medium):** substantive read-only tracing when the answer needs many files or commands, and separate diagnostic threads that need commands but no edits, such as checking a second service while you debug the first.
- **`reviewer` (medium):** one fresh review of the final diff of a non-trivial change.
- **`worker` (light):** mechanical edits, renames, boilerplate, docs, and narrow tests that are fully specified.
- **`verifier` (light):** builds, tests, linters, and reproductions. It reports failures and does not fix them.
- **`general-purpose` (heavy):** rare; for hard, decided work after the sidekick hits a concrete blocker.

## Write the message

Children start without your conversation. Settle interfaces, consequential choices, and hypotheses before dispatch, and specify rather than describe:

```text
Repo: <absolute path>
Goal: <one deliverable>
Known: <verified facts, decisions, files, running servers to reuse; mark anything unchecked as an assumption>
Scope: <files or directories it owns>
Leave alone: <files owned elsewhere, configuration, generated output>
Return: <fields>, at most <N> bullets, each with path:line
Stop when: <ambiguities or blockers that need you>
Validation: <exact commands, or none>
```

Children treat the known facts as settled and reopen them only for a concrete gap, so an unmarked guess becomes their premise. Don't tell a reviewer that code is already audited or safe; that kind of framing hides real bugs.

## Review what comes back

- A child's report is a claim; its diff and check output are the evidence. Read the whole change before acting, then send every correction in one follow-up to the same child.
- Don't rerun checks a child already passed unless the evidence is missing or looks wrong, or the inputs changed since.
- Treat a root cause without a shown failing path as a hypothesis.
- Answer `ask_parent` questions that are yours to decide with `reply_question`. Ask the user only for decisions that need their authority.
- Use one reviewer, not panels. In measured review runs, extra reviewers raised false positives without finding more defects. When two children disagree, check the disputed fact yourself instead of adding a voter.

## Concurrency and ownership

- One writer per file. Concurrent writers in a repository that builds or typechecks each get `isolation: "worktree"`.
- About four read-only children or three editing children at once is a sensible ceiling unless the user sets another. Run heavy builds and test suites one child at a time when they compete for CPU, memory, or locks.
- Delegation hands over ownership: don't edit inside a running child's scope or redo its work afterwards.
- After compaction or a restart, check `list_agents` and the files on disk before relaunching anything.

## Escalate and recover

- **Ambiguity:** decide it, then continue the same child with the decision.
- **Escalation:** move work from a light profile to `explore` or `sidekick` when it needs real tracing or implementation. Take it back if the sidekick reports BLOCKED twice or the task turns judgment-heavy.
- **Failures:** allow one scoped retry, then re-scope or take the work back. Upstream server errors and concurrency limits usually clear, so retry once with fewer children running; authentication and quota failures don't clear by retrying.
- **Fallback:** when no child can run, do bounded work directly and say so.
