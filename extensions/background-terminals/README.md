# Pi background terminals

Session-scoped background pseudo-terminals for Pi. The extension combines Codex-style PTY input and cursor reads with bounded capture, size-limited private logs, automatic completion delivery, process-group shutdown, and a live Pi control center.

## Model tools

- `start_terminal` — start a long-running or interactive command in a PTY.
- `read_terminal` — read retained or incremental output, with optional long polling.
- `write_terminal` — send input or control characters and collect the response.
- `list_terminals` — list running and settled terminals.
- `stop_terminal` — stop complete process groups with TERM-to-KILL escalation.

Each output response carries a byte cursor; pass it to the next read or write to get only new output. The tools render as compact cards with expandable output, use `model-only` exposure, and running terminals appear in the shared **Active work** dock with elapsed time and the latest output line.

When a model-started terminal exits, its status and a bounded output tail are delivered as a custom message. An idle parent starts a new turn for it; a busy parent receives it, together with any other pending results, when its run settles. The message never appears as user-authored or follow-up input, and reading the terminal does not suppress it.

## User interface

`/term`, `/term list`, and `/ps` open the fullscreen control center. `/term start <command>` starts the process and immediately returns to the editor; `/term stop <id> [id…]` stops exact processes. The control center provides:

- live counts and status;
- terminal list with a selected-session inspector;
- live output, elapsed time, dimensions, command, cwd, and full-log size;
- real PTY input: every printable key goes to the process;
- Ctrl+C delivery to the PTY;
- PgUp/PgDn scrolling;
- a two-press Ctrl+X process-stop guard in the detail view.

## Lifecycle and safety

- Maximum eight concurrent terminals and 32 tracked entries.
- Newest 2 MiB retained in memory per terminal.
- Raw output spills to a mode-`0600` file under a mode-`0700` temporary session directory, capped at 64 MiB per terminal.
- Under Node, spill backpressure pauses and resumes the PTY. Bun's terminal API has no pause, so the 64 MiB cap is the only bound there. Reaching the cap stops log growth while retaining the newest live-output tail.
- Pruning an old settled terminal deletes its spill file immediately; session shutdown removes the complete temporary directory.
- Output is sanitized before TUI or model rendering.
- Processes run in their own PTY process group and are stopped on session shutdown, replacement, or reload.
- Shutdown and stop operations are bounded and escalate from SIGTERM to SIGKILL. A stop finishes only when the whole process group is gone, including descendants that outlive the shell and ignore hangup.
- Completion delivery is keyed by terminal id, so each terminal produces at most one result message.
